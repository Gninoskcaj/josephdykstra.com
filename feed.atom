        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello from the Dykstra Family!</p>
<p>What a crazy year 2016 has been for us!  Gilbert has been beekeeping, and he added onto his shed (with the boys' help).  Gilbert and Donna planted, watered, tended, and harvested our garden.  Donna and Rebecca went to a camp called Joni and Friends where they assisted families of disabled children.  Rebecca got married!  (Some said it would never happen, but I guess she proved them wrong!)  Joseph is working as a computer programmer.  Levi is working for a landscaper, and is in college for horticulture.  Daniel is working for David who is a general contractor, and is in college to become an electrician.  Nathanael is still being homeschooled.</p>
<p>In January, Jordon and Jessica had their 4th child, Isabella Cave.</p>
<p>In February, Micah Swab's courtship with Rebecca was announced.  (For the uninitiated, courting is like dating, but with Gilbert and Donna being more involved, which they quite liked!)  Micah asked for Gilbert and Donna's permission to court Rebecca several months prior.  A few of the kids had suspicions that Micah was starting a courtship.  We were all elated to have his suitorship confirmed.</p>
<p>March marked Gilbert and Donna's 31st Anniversary.  They left the kids at the house (scary!) and went to a Bed &amp; Breakfast near Plattsmouth, Nebraska.</p>
<p>May was a busy month!  Levi graduated from High School, so we hosted a graduation party which featured volleyball and delicious beverages.  Unfortunately Levi may have had a little too much of both, because about a week later, he was admitted to the hospital and had his appendix removed.
Gilbert and Donna drove Daniel and Nathanael to the Lego Razorback competition in Arkansas where they competed  with their FLL team.
Jordon and Jessica moved to Glenwood, Iowa after Jordon accepted a job in Clarinda, Iowa.  Seth and Laura moved from their apartment into a house, also in May.</p>
<p>Early in July, Micah proposed to Rebecca.  She said yes, of course, and so we ate ice cream and watched the hidden-camera footage of the proposal.  It was adorable!
Later in July, we had a family from church camp in our back-yard.  They had to move due to their husband's military job, and providentially their house sold more quickly than they expected.  They were awesome guests, and we thoroughly enjoyed our time together!  A fringe benefit for us was, they took care of the house and dog chores while we went on vacation.
In mid-July, we left on vacation to Alberta, Canada.  We wanted one last family vacation before Rebecca left.  We saw all kinds of wildlife and majestic landscapes.</p>
<p>In August, David and Ruth had their 3rd child, Jochebed Dykstra.</p>
<p>Late in October, our brave back-yard campers left for the outpost where they were stationed.  It was sad to see them go.</p>
<p>Micah and Rebecca's wedding was in December.  They were married in the oldest church in Nebraska.  They will return from their honeymoon a few days after Christmas.</p>
<p>We hope you all had an awesome year too!</p>
<p>Love,
The Dykstra Family</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Matthew 24:1-34</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place" (whoever reads, let him understand), "then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore if they say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are unaware of how many Christians see this passage, try reading this: <a href="http://heavenscity.com/2016/04/05/5-signs-that-jesus-is-going-to-return-soon/">5 signs that Jesus is going to return soon</a>, and maybe the comment section as well (if you're into that sort of thing).</p>
<p>The Great Tribulation has already happened. You can read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(AD_70)">Siege of Jerusalem</a>. If you hear wars an rumors of wars today, it doesn't mean Jesus is coming back soon, since this prophecy has already been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Jesus says very plainly that the Tribulation will occur in some of the listeners' lifetimes.</p>
<p>After talking about the Siege of Jerusalem, Jesus went on to talk about the end times. (Remember that His disciples asked about both the destruction of the temple, and the end times in verse 3.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Jesus explains that we <em>won't</em> have signs telling us when the end times are coming. If the Great Tribulation = End Times, then this makes no sense, becuase Jesus Himself just told them signs for the Great Tribulation!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vote for a candidate that has no chance of winning is a vote for the majority.</p>
<p>— Facebook Comment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not convinced that a vote for a candidate that can't win is a vote for the leader (a.k.a. "majority"). I've decided to run the numbers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's imagine that there are 10,000 voters, not including you:</p>
<ul>
<li>4500 are voting for Candidate Clam Chowder</li>
<li>4000 are voting for Kandidate Ketchup</li>
<li>1500 are voting for Candidate Creamy Cool Whip</li>
</ul>
<p>You are a supporter of Candidate Creamy Cool Whip, and you strongly <em>distaste</em> Cadidate Clam Chowder. You're not a fan of Kandidate Ketchup, but "Ketchup is a bit better than Clam Chowder", you tell yourself.</p>
<p>Election day is coming up, and the Ketchuppers say that if you don't vote for Kandidate Ketchup, you're voting for Candidate Clam Chowder.</p>
<p>Here are the two scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>You give in the demands, and cast your vote for Ketchup</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Clam Chowder: 4500 votes</li>
<li>Ketchup: 4001 votes</li>
<li>Creamy Cool Whip: 1500 votes</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>You say "deal with it!" to the Ketchuppers, and you stand with your fellow Cool Whippers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Clam Chowder: 4500 votes</li>
<li>Ketchup: 4000 votes</li>
<li>Creamy Cool Whip: 1501 votes</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, I just ran the numbers; feel free to double-check them. In each scenarios, Clam Chowder had the same number of votes: 4500. It is clear that a vote for Creamy Cool Whip was not a vote for Clam Chowder. You know what <em>is</em> a vote for Clam Chowder? Voting for Clam Chowder.</p>
<p>The Ketchuppers are attempting to get your vote. Are you comprimising your morals if you give it to them?</p>

        <updated>2016-08-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going to read <a href="http://www.thegreatfiction.com/2016/07/30/the-moral-case-for-donald-trump-refuted/">a refutation</a> to Wayne Grudem's article about voting for Trump, but then I saw the dreaded "wall of text". The small scrollbar whispered, "Is this really how you want to spend your time?"  And so instead of reading a few paragraphs, I decided to see if I can construct a shorter refutation.</p>
<p>In Wayne Grudem's article, <em><a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/waynegrudem/2016/07/28/why-voting-for-donald-trump-is-a-morally-good-choice-n2199564">Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice</a></em>, under the <em>A good candidate with flaws</em> section, he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a <em>flawed</em> candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Bible, there are minimal requirements for rulers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+23%3A3&amp;version=NKJV">2 Samuel 23:3</a>  <br>
He who rules over men must be just, Ruling in the fear of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(See longer post by Phillip Kayser about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/philkayser/posts/10157270314665311">minimal requirements for rulers</a>.)</p>
<p>Does Trump fear God? I believe the answer is a definite "no".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href>John 14:12,15</a>  <br>
"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.</p>
<p>If you love Me, keep My commandments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump does not lead a Godly life, nor does he claim to. Trump is unfit for office, according to God's word.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a fan of podcasts, and I recently purchased an android phone. I needed an app to handle podcasts for me. I have a few requirements for a podcast app:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want the app to automatically download the episodes from oldest to newest</li>
<li>I want the app to delete the listened episodes</li>
<li>I want the UI to be simple, and intuitive</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried 4 well-rated apps: AntennaPod, Podcast Republic, Podkicker, and Podcast Addict</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: Facts such as ratings and features of apps might change after I write this review.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="antennapod">AntennaPod</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod">AntennaPod</a> is rated 4.5 stars on the google play store. It is ad-free and open source.</p>
<p>The UI is great. It is simple, intuitive, and I like how it is set up.</p>
<p>It does have an auto-download, and auto-delete. However, it doesn't support downloading from oldest to newest, so it's out.</p>
<h2 id="podcast-republic">Podcast Republic</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app&amp;hl=en">Podcast Republic</a> is rated 4.4 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>The UI is beautiful. The app feel like it was created by a designer; it acts in non-android-standard ways. This makes it less intuitive, but allows the app to be cleaner. This app is a bit confusing with the many screens it has.</p>
<p>Lots of settings for this app, but they're well organized, so you can easily find the setting you're looking for.</p>
<p>This app has auto-download and auto-delete. It's unable to auto-download oldest to newest, so I am not keeping it.</p>
<h2 id="podkicker">Podkicker</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ait.podka">Podkicker</a> is rated 4.2 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>This app is hands-down the simplest UI for a podcast app of the four. Very intuitive, and easy to use, but the simplicity has its downsides, including making it harder to do some bulk tasks, but this was rather minor.</p>
<p>The app seems to lack an auto-delete, but it has a new-episodes-only auto-download. Goodbye app.</p>
<h2 id="podcast-addict">Podcast Addict</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict">Podcast Addict</a> is rated 4.6 stars on the google play store. It is ad-supported.</p>
<p>This podcast player has a bunch of features that I don't (and probably will never) use, such as playlists, and live streams. There are <em>a lot</em> of settings, but they start with pretty good defaults, so it's not an issue.</p>
<p>This was the only app I could find that would download from oldest to newest. I've set a limit of 10 auto-downloaded episodes per show, so I don't fill up my phone right away.</p>
<p>The UI is pretty good, and not too hard to figure out as you go. It also has silence skipping, which is sort of neat.</p>
<p>I'm really liking this app, and I got the <strong>Donate</strong> version. If you like the app, it's worth supporting the developer (and removing ads) by throwing a few bucks his way.</p>
<h2 id="you-re-so-picky">You're so picky!</h2>
<p>Maybe you're saying, "one silly feature destroyed most of your options!"</p>
<p>I don't want to have to think about my podcast app. If I have to think about it, or manually download episodes before driving, then it's not doing it's job as well as it should.</p>
<h2 id="bye">Bye</h2>
<p>I hope this helps you decide on a podcast app. Thanks for reading!</p>
